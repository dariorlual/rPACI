# Version 0.2.2

* Updated DESCRIPTION with author's new contact data

# Version 0.2.1

* A few more bugs fixed
* Several typos fixed in documentation

# Version 0.2.0

This is a **major update**, with increased functionality and new features, easier workflow and more flexibility, improved and extended documentation, and the addition of 4 vignettes:

## New features

* Now the package is available also in GitHub in addition to CRAN.
* Added support to a new file format following the rPACI's datasets structure.
* New functions `readrPACI` and `writerPACI` to read and write rPACI's datasets to files.
* New wrapper function `readFile`, able to read data in any supported file format (to be used by default).
* Added a flexible, new function `simulateData` to obtain simulated corneal measurements with various parameters.
* New function `analyzeEvolution` to analyze the temporal evolution of an eye with different measurements, including graphics.
* Added new function `analyzeDataset`, similar to `analyzeFile`, but for data already on memory instead of on disk.
* Added new corneal topography files in the new format (obtained by simulation).
* Included 4 vignettes to explain in full detail the package behavior and possibilities:
	+ Corneal topographers and data formats
	+ Mathematical definition of the indices
	+ Simulating corneal datasets
	+ Workflow of the rPACI package 

## Enhancements

* Improved code to avoid as many hard-coded operations as possible.
* Refactoring function name: `readCornealTopography` -> `readCSO` (as it reads a file format used by CSO topographers).
* Reading function `readCSO` now analyzes the file and identifies its header.
* Reading function `readCSO` is more flexible with the inclusion of many format parameters.
* Clarified the topography files source (see vignette 'Workflow of the rPACI package').
* Added internal function `checkDataset` to verify the consistency of a rPACI's dataset.

## Bug fixes

* Small bugs fixed in `computePlacidoIndices`
* Bug fix in right-side plot of `plotSingleCornea`
* General cleaning of code and documentation
