\description{
Read corneal topography files as exported by Placido disk corneal topographer.
A corneal topographer is an ophthalmic clinical device that obtains measurements
in the cornea (the anterior part of the eye). A Placido disk corneal topographer
makes use of the Placido disk (see references), which produce a circular pattern of
measurement nodes.
This function assumes a file structure of 24 rings * 256 angles per ring,
which is the typical distribution of commercial Placido disk topographers.
